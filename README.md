This Python script utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect faces in real-time through your webcam. It captures video frames, processes them using MediaPipe's Face Detection module, and displays the live feed. If a face is detected, it saves a snapshot of the frame for 5 seconds. After the capture duration, if no face is detected, it displays the saved face. The script continuously updates the frame and stops when the webcam feed ends. Dependencies include OpenCV, MediaPipe, and FontTools.
